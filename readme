Hi , this project is supposed to implement the algorithms by which the memory of the operating system is managed , 
it was an assignment in the operating system course last semester , it was meant to implement the algorithms effectively and properly
(to show how memory partitions are filled with different processes and how the OS deals with external fragments) 
so OOP principles were not implemented properly in this project
